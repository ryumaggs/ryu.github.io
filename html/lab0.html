<dt><b>Preliminaries</b>
</dt><dd>This lab consists of several simple tasks that you should complete 
    on your own as soon as possible -- and before your first lab meeting,
    which will be held during the second week of classes.  The tasks are:
    <ol>
    <li><a href="http://cs-people.bu.edu/dgs/courses/cs105/labs/lab0.html#coursepack">purchase the coursepack</a>
    </li><li><a href="http://cs-people.bu.edu/dgs/courses/cs105/labs/lab0.html#account">set up your CS account</a>
    </li><li><a href="http://cs-people.bu.edu/dgs/courses/cs105/labs/lab0.html#policies">review course policies</a>
    </li><li><a href="http://cs-people.bu.edu/dgs/courses/cs105/labs/lab0.html#survey">complete a survey</a>
    </li></ol>
<p>
    If you encounter any problems
    while completing these tasks, feel free to email the course account:<br> 
<font face="courier">
</font></p><pre><font face="courier">       cs105-staff@cs.bu.edu
</font></pre><font face="courier">

    In general, you should use this email address for course-related 
    questions, because doing so forwards your email to all staff
    members and increases the likelihood of a quick reply.

</a></p></dd><dt><a name="coursepack"><b>Task 1: purchase the coursepack</b>
</a></dt><dd><a name="coursepack">A coursepack with the lecture notes for the course is available
    for purchase

    <!--- **** CONFIRM THIS INFO. **** 
    <b>by Friday (September 5) at noon</b>-->

    at the BU branch of Fedex Office, which is located
    at 115 Cummington Mall (around the corner from the Campus Convenience
    in Warren Towers). It should cost approximately $20.

    Please purchase it by the start of the second week of lectures
    and bring it to all lectures. (Note: You may need to go to 
    FedEx twice: once to request a copy and a second time to pick it up.)
<p>
</p></a></dd><dt><a name="coursepack"><b>Task 2: set up your CS account</b>
</a></dt><dd><a name="coursepack">In order to use the computing resources of the computer science
    department, you need to set up a CS account, which is different
    from your regular BU account.  To do so, you will need to go the
    </a><a href="http://www.cs.bu.edu/labs/index.html">CS undergraduate lab</a>, 
    which is located in EMA 302 (730 Commonwealth Avenue, upstairs from
    Radio Shack; the main entrance is by Espresso Royale). <b>Make sure
    to bring your BU ID with you to the lab.</b>
<p>
</p></dd><dd>Once you get to EMA 302, you should perform the account-creation process
    using one of the Unix machines, which are located 
    on the left-hand side of the lab.
    Directions for doing so should be available when you enter the lab;
    ask one of the people at the help window if you don't see an
    instruction sheet. 
<p>
    After you have completed the instructions for creating an account,
    <b>show your BU ID to someone at the window</b>. You are then free to
    leave the lab.

</a></dt><dd><a name="policies">As your next task, please review the policies of the course, which
    are outlined in the </a><a href="http://cs-people.bu.edu/dgs/courses/cs105/syllabus.pdf">syllabus</a> and
    on the <a href="http://cs-people.bu.edu/dgs/courses/cs105/index.shtml#info">course homepage</a>.  
    In particular, please review carefully the
    <a href="http://cs-people.bu.edu/dgs/courses/collaboration.html">collaboration policy</a> 
    for this course. Note that copying another student's
    work or allowing another student to copy your work is not allowed.
    After you have read over these policies, feel free to let us know
    if you have any questions.
