Classification Learning

0R - 

Normal or Reduced, either will achieve an equal accuracy on our training set.

1R

age:

young --> reduced 5/8            
pre-presbyopic --> reduced 4/8         
presbyopic --> normal  5/8              accuracy = 14/24 

spectacle-prescri:

myope --> reduced  7/12           
hypermetrope --> normal  7/12           accuracy = 14/24

astigmatism:
no --> reduced  6/12	         
yes  --> normal  6/12                   accuracy = 12/24

Contact-lenses:
none  -- reduced  11/15            
soft  --> normal  5/5                  
hard  --> normal  3/4                   accuracy = 19/24

Contact-lenses has the highest accuracy, and is the best one-attribute
classifier according to 1R.


Decision tree building

Consider goodness score
age = 14/72, spectacle-prescri = 14/48, astigmatism = 12/48, contact-lenses = 19/48

Consider contact-lenses = none

age:
young --> reduced 4/4    
pre-presbyopic --> reduced 4/5  
presbyopic --> reduced 3/6              accuracy = 11/15   goodness = 11/30

spec-prescrip:
myope -->  reduced 6/7  
hypermetrope --> reduced 5/8            accuracy = 11/15   goodness = 11/30

astigmatism:
yes --> reduced  5/8   
no --> reduced  6/7                    accuracy = 11/15   goodness = 11/30

Consider contact-lense = hard

age:
young --> reduced           1/2     
pre-presbyopic --> normal   1/1     
presbyopic  -->  normal     1/1         accuracy = 3/4  goodness = 3/4

spectacle-prescri:
myope  -->  normal          2/3  
hypermetrope  -->  normal   1/1         accuracy = 3/4  goodness = 3/4


astigmatism:
yes  -->  normal       3/4              accuracy = 3/4  goodness = 3/4



Consider contact-lenses = none, age = pre-presbyopic

spectacle-prescri:
myope --> reduced    2/2
hypermetrope --> reduced  2/3          accuracy = 4/5     goodness = 4/5

astigmatism:
no -->  reduced  2/2
yes --> reduced  2/3                   accuracy = 4/5     goodness = 4/5


Consider contact-lense = none, age = presbyopic

spectacle-prescri:
myope   -->  reduced       2/3  
hypermetrope  --> normal   2/3        accuracy = 4/6    goodness = 4/12

astigmatism:
no  -->  reduced   2/3        
yes -->  normal    2/3                accuracy = 4/6    goodness = 4/12


We then continue in this way for all possible sub groups
(so long as you understand (and can reproduce) everything here, you're all set)
