(a) 

three-item sets:

spectacle_prescr = myope, astigmatism = yes, tear-prod-rate = reduced
spectacle_prescr = myope, astigmatism = yes, tear-prod-rate = normal
spectacle_prescr = myope, astigmatism = yes, contact-lenses = none
spectacle_prescr = myope, astigmatism = no, tear-prod-rate = reduced
spectacle_prescr = myope, astigmatism = no, tear-prod-rate = normal
spectacle_prescr = myope, astigmatism = no, contact-lenses = none
spectacle_prescr = myope, tear-prod-rate = reduced, contact-lenses = none
spectacle_prescr = myope, tear-prod-rate = normal, contact-lenses = none
spectacle_prescr = hypermetrope, astigmatism = no, tear-prod-rate = reduced
spectacle_prescr = hypermetrope, astigmatism = yes, tear-prod-rate = reduced

(b) 

3-item set (support 4):

spectacle_prescr = myope, astigmatism = yes, tear-prod-rate = reduced
spectacle_prescr = myope, astigmatism = no, contact-lenses = none

(c) 

For the first 3-items set, any 2 of the following would be correct:

if spectacle_prescr = myope 
then astigmatism = yes and tear-prod-rate = reduced;
if astigmatism = yes
then spectacle_prescr = myope and tear-prod-rate = reduced;
if tear-prod-rate = reduced
then spectacle_prescr = myope and astigmatism = yes;
if spectacle_prescr = myope and astigmatism = yes 
then tear-prod-rate = reduced;
if spectacle_prescr = myope and tear-prod-rate = reduced
then astigmatism = yes;
if astigmatism = yes and tear-prod-rate = reduced
then spectacle_prescr = myope

I will select the following 2:

Rule 1:
if astigmatism = yes
then spectacle_prescr = myope and tear-prod-rate = reduced;

Rule 2:
if astigmatism = yes and tear-prod-rate = reduced
then spectacle_prescr = myope


Rule 1 has confidence of 4/12 = 0.33
Rule 2 has confidence of 4/6 = 0.67

(d)
Rule 2 has higher confidence than Rule 1
